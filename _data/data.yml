    title: Career Profile
    summary: |
      I am a Education Sciences student looking to move to Broadstairs during next year.
      I enjoy working with children and I am looking for a job/training experience in August 2019 so that
      I can make some experience before moving there.

education:
    - degree: BSc in Education Sciences
      university: Università Suor Orsola Benincasa
      time: 2016 - 2019
      details: |
        The degree course enables students to acquire the theoretical and practical competences required to work in the field
        of educational sciences. In order to develop fully qualified professional figures, in-depth study is carried out in
        the fields of pedagogy, psychology, philosophy, history and anthropo-sociology.

        Throughout the three years, students will acquire theoretical, epistemological and methodological knowledge of the many
        different issues pertaining to the field of education and training: a thorough knowledge of the epistemological paradigms
        which, both in the past and in the present, have characterized contemporary multidisciplinary research in this field;
        a knowledge of the theories which characterize the training, development and learning processes pertaining
        to the different stages in an individual's life (lifelong learning); a grounded awareness of the educational problems
        which emerge from the analysis of social, cultural and territorial realities; an ability to plan, manage, monitor
        and evaluate educational schemes and projects; an ability to carry out research in the field of education.

        In the course of their studies, students can opt to concentrate on one of the following areas pertaining
        to the educating professions: childcare services; social assistance and cultural services; educational services
        in school contexts. By the end of their studies, graduates must have acquired an adequate level of written and 
        spoken English and satisfactory communication skills.

experiences:
    - role: Tutor for students with special needs
      time: 2017 - 2019
      company: Università Suor Orsola Benincasa
      details: |
        I was a tutor for students with special needs for two years in my university. My activity consisted in
        attending classes, helping them with both personal relationships and studying activities, from taking notes in class
        to studying. As part of the job, I had to write down a report about the student after every encounter to track
        both the student's progress and my progress. 
        
    - role: Volunteer for children's hospital
      time: 2016 - 2017
      company: Abio Napoli, www.abionapoli.org
      details: |
        I volunteered part-time in a children's hospital for a year during my first year of university.
        Activities included visiting the pediatric ward and doing recreational activities with them like coloring,
        reading and puppetry.
