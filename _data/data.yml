      I am a Education Sciences student looking to move to Broadstairs during next year.

education:
    - degree: BSc in Education Sciences

      details: |
        The degree course enables students to acquire the theoretical and practical competences required to work in the field
        of educational sciences. In order to develop fully qualified professional figures, in-depth study is carried out in
        the fields of pedagogy, psychology, philosophy, history and anthropo-sociology.

        Throughout the three years, students will acquire theoretical, epistemological and methodological knowledge of the many
        different issues pertaining to the field of education and training: a thorough knowledge of the epistemological paradigms
        which, both in the past and in the present, have characterized contemporary multidisciplinary research in this field;
        a knowledge of the theories which characterize the training, development and learning processes pertaining
        to the different stages in an individual's life (lifelong learning); a grounded awareness of the educational problems
        which emerge from the analysis of social, cultural and territorial realities; an ability to plan, manage, monitor
        and evaluate educational schemes and projects; an ability to carry out research in the field of education.

        In the course of their studies, students can opt to concentrate on one of the following areas pertaining
        to the educating professions: childcare services; social assistance and cultural services; educational services
        in school contexts. By the end of their studies, graduates must have acquired an adequate level of written and 
        spoken English and satisfactory communication skills.
